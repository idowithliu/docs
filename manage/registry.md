You may post **multiple** registries, each for a <u>specific category</u> (e.g. "Kitchen", or "Appliances", etc.) each of these is called a "Registry".

## Adding a Registry
To add a registry, click the **"Add Registry"** button on the top-right corner of your screen.

Each registry is a list of `Registry Items`, which you can fill out as below:
> Important Note: Please **only** fill out the Registry Item **Names**, not the *Claimer* field.

Afterwards, save your changes by pressing the **"Save"** button at the bottom-right corner.

> **IMPORTANT:** Once satisfied with the registry content, check the **"Visible on Site (Published)"** box to publish the registry to the site. A screenshot is included below.

Once the registry is published, you can view it on the website at [https://idowithliu.com/registry](https://idowithliu.com/registry). 

There, invitees can claim any registry items they are willing to purchase. They can only do so after they have submitted their RSVP. Once someone claimes a registry item, their name will appear in the **"Claimer"** field, as shown below.
